# BeyondBackgrounds
Our application aims to revolutionize the way resume filtering is conducted,  particularly by ensuring that job skills are assessed independently of a candidate's  criminal record. This approach sets us apart from traditional software solutions by  providing a fair and unbiased hiring process.

# Use Cases
## Skill-Based Matching: 
Our software identifies and matches a candidateâ€™s skills 
with job requirements, eliminating the influence of criminal records on initial 
screening.
##Diversity and Inclusion: 
Promoting diversity by preventing discrimination based 
on criminal history, thus ensuring a broader pool of candidates.
##Efficient Hiring:
Reducing the time and effort needed for manual screening, leading 
to faster and more efficient hiring processes.
# Users
## HR Professionals: These users will interact with the system to create job postings, 
define skill requirements, and review matched candidates' profiles without access to 
criminal record information.
## Recruiters: 
Responsible for conducting initial screenings, recruiters will use the 
software to shortlist candidates based on skills and qualifications, removing personal 
biases.
## Candidates:
Applicants can view job listings, submit resumes, and track their 
application status, confident that their criminal records won't be a determining factor 
in the initial screening process.
